This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript's handling of null and undefined values.  The provided code (bug.js) contains a function that attempts to handle null values gracefully, but still may unexpectedly return 0 under circumstances where it is not expected. The solution (bugSolution.js) demonstrates improved error handling and more robust null/undefined checks.
